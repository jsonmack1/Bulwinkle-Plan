**SEL Competencies:** Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness  

#### Learning Objectives:
- Students will understand the neurological basis of emotional responses
- Students will apply brain science to develop personalized emotion regulation strategies
- Students will practice advanced emotional granularity and vocabulary

#### Materials:
- Brain diagram handouts (amygdala, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus highlighted)
- Emotion granularity wheels with 100+ specific emotion words
- Biometric awareness tracking sheets
- Calming essential oil samples (optional)
- Timer for mindfulness exercises

#### Lesson Structure:

**Opening: Real-Time Emotion Tracking (8 minutes)**
- Students take baseline measurements:
  - Heart rate (15 seconds x 4)
  - Breathing rate (count for 1 minute)
  - Muscle tension self-assessment (1-10 scale for shoulders, jaw, hands)
  - Emotional state using advanced emotion wheel (not just "happy/sad/mad")
- Discuss: "Your body is constantly giving you data about your emotional state"

**Main Activity: Brain Science Application (28 minutes)**

*Phase 1: Neuroeducation (10 minutes)*
- Interactive explanation of emotional processing:
  - **Amygdala:** "Smoke detector" - rapid threat assessment, triggers fight/flight/freeze
  - **Prefrontal Cortex:** "CEO brain" - logical thinking, decision-making, emotional regulation
  - **Hippocampus:** Memory center that provides context for emotions
- Key insight: "You have a 6-second window before stress hormones flood your system"
- Practice: Count to 6 during mild stress simulation (unexpected loud noise or surprise quiz announcement)

*Phase 2: Personalized Regulation Strategy Development (12 minutes)*
- Students identify their personal "amygdala hijack" patterns:
  - What situations trigger immediate emotional reactions?
  - What physical sensations do you notice first?
  - How does your thinking change when emotions are high?
- Create individualized "6-Second Strategy" based on personal patterns:
  - **Visual learners:** Mental imagery techniques (calm place visualization)
  - **Kinesthetic learners:** Physical grounding (feel feet on floor, hand pressure points)
  - **Auditory learners:** Internal mantras or calming sounds
- Test strategies with mild stress simulation exercises

*Phase 3: Advanced Emotional Granularity Practice (6 minutes)*
- Move beyond basic emotion categories to specific emotional experiences:
  - Instead of "anxious" → worried, apprehensive, overwhelmed, restless, on-edge
  - Instead of "happy" → content, elated, grateful, proud, peaceful, excited
- Partner practice: Describe recent emotional experience using precise vocabulary
- Discuss how specific emotion words lead to more targeted coping strategies

**Closure: Biometric Check and Reflection (4 minutes)**
- Retake baseline measurements after mindfulness practice
- Compare before/after data to see physiological impact of awareness
- Set intention for using brain science knowledge in real-world situations

#### Advanced Discussion Questions:
- How might understanding your brain's emotional processing change your relationships?

    - *Interests:* Feeling included, maintaining friendship, avoiding loneliness, being part of conversation
- Practice with personal examples: Students identify interests behind their own recent disagreements
- Key principle: "People's positions are often opposite, but their interests usually overlap"

*Phase 2: Multi-Step Conflict Resolution Process (15 minutes)*
- Introduce sophisticated conflict resolution framework:
  1. **Separate People from Problems:** Attack the issue, not the person
  2. **Focus on Interests, Not Positions:** Ask "Why is this important to you?"
  3. **Generate Options for Mutual Gain:** Brainstorm before deciding
  4. **Use Objective Criteria:** Fair standards both parties can accept

- Apply to complex scenario: "Group project grade dispute"
  - Multiple students, competing priorities (grades, friendship, fairness, time management)
  - Students work in teams to develop comprehensive solutions
  - Present solutions using evidence-based criteria

*Phase 3: Real-World Application Practice (6 minutes)*
