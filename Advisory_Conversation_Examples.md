# Advisory Conversation Examples
*Natural, Relationship-Building Conversations for Middle & High School*

## Sample Framework: **Stress and Overwhelm**

### Opening the Circle
*"So I've been wondering... how are you all really doing with everything on your plates right now? Like, actually doing - not the 'fine' we usually say in the hallways."*

**If they need a gentle start:**
- *"What's one thing that's been on your mind lately?"*
- *"When you wake up in the morning, what's the first thought that hits you?"*
- *"Show me with your hands how full your life feels right now" (hands apart = manageable, hands close = overwhelming)*

### Conversation Starters
- *"What does stress actually feel like for you? Like, where do you notice it in your body?"*
- *"Who in your life really gets it when you're overwhelmed?"*
- *"What's something adults say about stress that just doesn't land right with you?"*
- *"If stress was a weather pattern, what would yours be like lately?"*

### If the conversation goes toward...

**Academic pressure:**
*"Tell me about a time when school stress felt manageable vs. when it felt impossible. What was different?"*

**Family expectations:**
*"How do you handle it when what you want for yourself and what others want for you don't match up?"*

**Social media/comparison:**
*"When do you find yourself comparing your real life to other people's highlight reels?"*

**Future worries:**
*"What's one worry about the future that keeps showing up, even when you try to push it away?"*

### Drawing Out Quiet Voices
- *"For those who process by thinking first, take a minute to jot down one thought if you want"*
- *"What would you want someone your age to know about this?"*
- *"Is there something you wish adults understood about what this feels like?"*

### Natural Wrap-Up
When energy starts to wind down or you're near time:
*"What's one thing someone said today that stuck with you? Doesn't have to be life-changing - just something that made you think."*

Or: *"If your best friend was dealing with what we talked about today, what would you want them to know?"*

## Sample Framework: **Friendship Changes**

### Opening the Circle
*"Here's something I've been curious about - friendships are so different now than they were even a few years ago for you all. What's that been like?"*

- *"Think about a friendship that's changed recently - not necessarily good or bad, just... different."*
- *"What's something about friendship that no one really talks about but probably should?"*
- *"How do you know when a friendship is actually working for you?"*

### Conversation Starters
- *"What's the difference between being friendly and being a friend?"*
- *"When have you realized you've outgrown a friendship? What was that like?"*

*"What makes it easier or harder to let new people in?"*

**Social groups:**
*"How do you stay true to yourself when group dynamics get weird?"*

### For the Reflective Moment
*"Take a second to think - if you could text one friend right now just to appreciate them, who would it be and what would you say?"*

*(They don't have to share this - it's just for them)*

### Natural Wrap-Up
*"What's one thing about friendship you want to remember from today's conversation?"*

Or: *"How do you want to show up in your friendships this week - even in small ways?"*

## Sample Framework: **Digital Life vs. Real Life**

### Opening the Circle
*"I'm curious about something - when you're scrolling through your phone, how often do you feel better afterward versus... not so much?"*

**Easy starters:**
- *"What's your most honest relationship with your phone right now?"*
- *"When does being online feel good versus when does it feel kind of gross?"*
- *"Show me with your face what you look like after a really good day online vs. a day that left you feeling blah"*

**Screen time concerns:**
*"When does your phone feel like a tool that serves you versus when does it feel like it's controlling you?"*

**Online drama:**
*"How do you handle conflict differently when it's happening through screens versus face-to-face?"*

### Quiet Processing Option
*"Take a minute to think - if you could change one thing about how you interact with technology, what would it be? Just for you to think about."*

### Natural Wrap-Up
*"What's one small thing you want to try this week with how you use technology - not a big dramatic change, just something that might feel better?"*

## Facilitation Tips for All Conversations

### Creating Safety
- *"What we share here stays here - that's how we build trust"*
- *"No advice-giving unless someone specifically asks for it"*
- *"It's okay to say 'I'm not ready to share that' or 'I need to think more'"*
- *"We're here to understand each other, not to fix each other"*

### When Conversations Stall
- *"What's something you're curious about that someone else said?"*
- *"Is there a question you wish I'd asked but haven't yet?"*
- *"What would your 12-year-old self think about this topic?"*
- *"What would you want adults to understand about this?"*

### Honoring Different Perspectives
- *"I'm hearing a few different experiences - what does that tell us?"*
- *"What would it be like if we're both right, just about different things?"*
- *"That's one way to see it - who else has a different take?"*

### When Someone Shares Something Heavy
- *"Thank you for trusting us with that"*
- *"What do you need from us right now?"*
- *"That sounds really hard"*
- *"How can we support you?"*

### Natural Transitions
- *"I'm noticing we're getting into..."*
- *"This is reminding me of..."*
- *"What else is coming up for people around this?"*
- *"Where else could this conversation go?"*

## Philosophy Reminders for Facilitators

**Your Role:**
- Be genuinely curious about their thoughts and experiences
- Ask follow-up questions that show you're listening: "What was that like?" "Tell me more about that"
- Share your own wondering sometimes: "I've been thinking about..." "I'm curious about..."
- Let silence be okay - some of the best insights come after quiet moments

**Trust the Process:**
- Students know more about their lives than we do
- The conversation they need is often different from the one we planned
- Follow their energy and interests
- Some conversations need to happen multiple times in different ways

**When Things Get Real:**
- Acknowledge when someone shares something vulnerable
- Know when to follow up privately after the conversation
- Have resources ready but don't make it clinical
- Remember that being heard is often more important than being "helped"

**Success Looks Like:**
- Students talking to each other, not just to you
- Quiet students participating in ways that work for them
- Conversations that continue after the bell rings
- Students feeling more connected to themselves and each other
- Moments of genuine laughter, insight, or "me too"

Remember: You're not trying to solve their problems or teach them the "right" answers. You're creating space for them to think about their lives, hear from others, and feel less alone in their experiences.
